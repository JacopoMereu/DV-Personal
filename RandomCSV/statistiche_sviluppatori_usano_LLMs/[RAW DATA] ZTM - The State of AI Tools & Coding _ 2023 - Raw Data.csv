For example, I recently built a website that helps in detecting the nearest Vercel fog server's location (https://fog.pratyushgoel.com). The website has a 3D earth model which can be rotated with a mouse (for PCs and laptops) or with 2 fingers (for touch devices). To have good UI the location markers needed to get automatically hidden / visible upon rotation. It’s like viewing the earth from satellite. And the problem can be stated as “given a satellite coordinate, will a coordinate on earth be visible or not?” This problem needs to consider the satellite’s coordinates, location’s coordinates, satellites height and even earth’s curvature.

Initially I had begun by searching for various equations related to satellites and geo stationary satellites but they weren't the exact fit to what I was looking for.

This will cause massive layoffs beyond anything we have seen in the past 50 years, and will cause a major shift in the work force towards the industries that are considered ""safe"", and since human consumption won't scale with the gigantic increases in content production capabilities, it will become exceedingly difficult to get hired, and salaries for these positions will likely suffer as well, especially for part-time workers and freelancers, who have considerably less laws and rights to protect them from abusive salaries. The genie is out of the bottle however, and AI is the future we must embrace, and it's not all bleak. AI's ability to produce content far beyond our capability to consume it, may eventually foster a new type of economy that is not entirely based on scarcity could ultimately result in less abusive work ethics and bring an end to poverty and famine in the world as well. With that said though, I think the road to that point will be painful and uncertain, especially past the 5 year mark.",Yes,"I have been using it to search, test thought processes, creating food plans, help me write and create content, course reviews, learning platform reviews, for my Youtube channel, learning in general, just about everything! I use it almost as much as I use my internet and google at this point! Once it improves even further and starts dishing out prompt results faster and with more accuracy, I will probably be using it more often than Google.","I have seen and used it in too many ways to describe them all, but Youtube content creation, reviews, writing, learning, grocery lists,  asking questions, practicing questions, designing websites, and prompt creation, are some of my favorites. With that said though, the API for paying users show a lot of promise and some of the coolest things that can only be done with the API are: Cryptocurrency or general trading, either as a tradebot or adviser, and creating knowledge bases and other similar specific content based on a person, personality or concept, creating very specific virtual beings we can consult for advice on a specific field!

While it enhances developers professional work I think it will also create a generation of people who are missing a lot of the skills that generations prior gained by not having AI to lean on.,Yes,Won't make a difference,I work for the Government and there is already a policy in place banning access to these tools.

Currently, the model may sometimes lose track of the conversation's context, leading to inconsistent or nonsensical responses.

Handling Ambiguity: AI models can struggle with ambiguous queries or statements. Improved capability to ask clarifying questions or provide suggestions when faced with ambiguous input would help in generating more accurate and relevant responses.

Explainability and Transparency: AI models often operate as ""black boxes,"" making it challenging for users to understand how the model arrived at a particular response. Providing explanations or justifications for generated answers would increase transparency and build trust with users.

Bias Mitigation: Efforts to address biases in AI models are crucial. Continual improvements should be made to reduce both glaring and subtle biases that may emerge in generated content. Mitigating biases ensures fair and unbiased responses, fostering inclusivity and diversity.

Controlled Output Generation: Offering users more control over the generated output is essential. Allowing users to specify guidelines, style preferences, or ethical boundaries in their interactions with AI models would ensure the content aligns with their intentions and values.

Data Privacy and Security: Maintaining robust data privacy and security measures is of utmost importance. Stricter safeguards should be in place to protect user data and prevent potential misuse.",No,No,,,Never tried it,Weekly,Tried it but don't use it,Tried it but don't use it,Never tried it,Tried it but don't use it,Never tried it,Never tried it,,Never tried it,,,Never tried it,,,,,Weekly,,,,,

Otherwise what ChatGPT is typing you won't understand! ,The Ai user can replace your job!,No,"Yes, for example I had a situation regarding my family.

But the code was not running. At last I had to match with the code of ZTM and my one but I could not find out the solution! I spend my whole day in this.

Continuous improvement, research, and responsible usage are key to addressing concerns and maximizing the positive impact of AI technology.",Yes,Positive impact,"Increased Transparency: Providing clearer explanations of how AI models arrive at their answers would be beneficial. This could include tracing the reasoning process, highlighting the sources of information used, and offering insights into the model's decision-making.

Better Handling of Ambiguity: AI tools could be improved to understand better and handle ambiguous queries or requests. Enhancements in natural language understanding and context comprehension would help reduce misinterpretation and provide more accurate and relevant responses.

Contextual Awareness: AI tools could be designed to understand better the context in which they are used. This would enable more accurate and contextually appropriate responses, taking into account variables such as location, time, and individual preferences.

Continual Learning and Adaptation: AI models could benefit from the ability to learn and adapt over time. Incorporating mechanisms for continuous training and updating based on new data and user feedback would ensure that the models stay up-to-date and improve their accuracy and performance.

Mitigating Bias and Ethical Considerations: Efforts should be made to address biases in training data and ensure fairness and inclusivity in AI systems. Robust strategies for identifying and mitigating bias, as well as regular audits and ethical guidelines, would contribute to more trustworthy and reliable AI tools.

User Customization and Control: Allowing users to personalize and customize AI tools according to their preferences and values would enhance their usefulness. Providing options to adjust the AI's behavior, filtering mechanisms, or integrating user feedback mechanisms would empower individuals to tailor the AI tools to their needs.",No,No,Basically replaced google search for me. ,"For me, Educational Assistance: I use ChatGPT to help my daughter with homework, explain complex concepts, and provide additional learning resources.

This would lessen the time taken to filter the information provided.",No,Yes,"I use it as an assistant for learning, productivity hacking, and even in terms of health like exercise recommendations, meal planning, and nutritional breakdown.

AI can't replace creativity in my opinion, but it helps streamline the thought process and routine tasks.","I've mostly used it on a personal level, especially in planning my self-learning curriculum. I am currently learning how I can use it to create a no-code app since some of the no-code platforms caught my interest. For example, I decided to focus on becoming a Python developer. I am using a few resources from Udemy, including ZTM courses as well as YouTube to learn. I noticed that there were way too many resources online to help with my learning and I began to get overwhelmed. I prompted ChatGPT for a lesson plan to highlight the topics I should focus on in Python. My studies are going a lot better now, and I am just missing the human component to interact with other developers and find a study buddy! I don't have an external link to the lesson plan, since it is on my Notion private page though. The no-code + ChatGPT app is in the planning stage, but essentially it's an app that will act as a personal chef (without the actual cooking). In my personal life, meal planning takes way too long. I started using ChatGPT to generate some meals to give me an idea of what to prepare that sticks with my diet. Eventually, I realized others could benefit from this with a user-friendly interface and design. I'm on the ZTM's discord group, so hopefully I can post my progress there :)",Never tried it,Never tried it,Tried it but don't use it,Never tried it,Never tried it,Never tried it,Never tried it,Never tried it,,Never tried it,,,Never tried it,,,,,Tried it but don't use it,,,,,

On the other hand, I sometimes use Bing Chat (Sydney). It can actually generate a meaningful response, but very often it's too short. Another thing I found out about Sydney is that it doesn't process its answers enough. From time to time it doesn't answer my actual question, but rather generates out-of-place response.

For example, we can ask ChatGPT to behave like a network security expert, and talk us through what'll happen when a vulerability is found, or if we have any questions regarding a certain topic, answer according to that. Not just as real human professions, ChatGPT can also act like things (or tools). For example, we can ask ChatGPT to behave like an Operating System, and ask it to explain everything it does when certain things are happening. For instance, if we have a multitasking OS with three CPU requiring tasks, we can ask ChatGPT to understand how OSs allocate task and how they perform batching and processing. 
It can also behave like a Database System, or a compiler even.

Improved language comprehension and contextual understanding would enhance the overall user experience.

Better Contextual Understanding: AI tools could be enhanced to better grasp the context of a conversation or query, especially in complex or nuanced situations. This would allow for more accurate and relevant responses.

Real-time Interaction: AI tools that can engage in real-time conversations, simulating human-like interaction, would be more appealing. This would involve reducing response latency and creating a more natural conversational flow.

Customization and Personalization: Providing users with the ability to customize and personalize AI tools according to their specific needs and preferences would be valuable. This could include options to modify language style, tone, or even the personality of the AI.

Enhanced Multimodal Capabilities: Integrating AI tools with multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio, would enable more versatile and comprehensive interactions. Users could benefit from AI systems that can analyze and generate content across different formats.

Ethical and Transparent AI: Users would be more inclined to use AI tools that are developed and deployed with transparency and ethical considerations in mind. This includes clear explanations of how AI makes decisions and ensuring fairness, accountability, and privacy.

Reduced Bias and Stereotyping: Users expect AI tools to minimize biases and avoid perpetuating stereotypes. Developers should strive to train AI models on diverse and inclusive datasets and implement mechanisms to address bias issues.

Improved Data Privacy and Security: Users are concerned about the privacy and security of their data when using AI tools. Stricter data protection measures, secure storage practices, and user-friendly privacy settings would help build trust and encourage wider adoption.

User-Friendly Interfaces: AI tools that feature intuitive and user-friendly interfaces would make them more accessible to individuals with varying technical backgrounds. Simplifying the interaction process and providing clear instructions can improve user adoption.

Enhanced Learning Capabilities: AI tools that can adapt and learn from user feedback would be highly desirable. Incorporating active learning techniques and continually updating models based on user input can lead to more accurate and personalized responses.",No,No,i have been using chatGPT for writing tests.,"Creative Writing: ChatGPT has been used by writers and artists as a creative tool to generate ideas, storylines, and even entire pieces of written content. It can assist in brainstorming, character development, and plot generation.

Virtual Assistants: AI models like ChatGPT have been employed as virtual assistants to provide customer support, answer frequently asked questions, and assist with basic tasks. They can handle a wide range of inquiries, freeing up human agents for more complex issues.

Language Learning: ChatGPT has been used as a conversational partner for language learners. It can provide practice opportunities, answer language-related questions, and simulate real-life conversations to improve fluency and proficiency.

Code Generation: AI models have been trained to generate code snippets or provide assistance in programming tasks. Developers can interact with ChatGPT to get suggestions, debug code, or explore different coding approaches.",Never tried it,Monthly,Tried it but don't use it,Never tried it,Never tried it,Daily,Never tried it,Never tried it,,Never tried it,,,Never tried it,,,,,Daily,,,,,

While English is commonly spoken in urban areas and among the educated population, a significant number of people are more comfortable in their regional languages. Adding more regional language support in AI tools would make them more usable and appealing to a broader range of people.

Affordability: Given that I fall under the middle class bracket, cost plays a significant role in the adoption of any technology. Although some AI tools are freely available, many require payment for advanced features. If AI tools can offer more affordable plans, or better value for money, it would definitely encourage more usage.",AI is capable of co,Yes,"Yes, I've made use of ChatGPT in various aspects of my personal life. Notably, it's been instrumental in aiding me in the learning and comprehension of new concepts. The AI's ability to break down complex topics into understandable pieces has greatly enhanced my self-learning journey.

Additionally, I've found ChatGPT to be a valuable companion for processing thoughts and seeking advice. The AI's objective input has often provided me with fresh perspectives. Plus, as a productivity tool, it's helped me manage my tasks more efficiently. In summary, ChatGPT serves a multifaceted role, acting as a learning aid, a virtual companion, and a personal productivity booster.","One of the coolest applications of ChatGPT I've experienced was during a challenging customer interaction. In a situation where I faced a tough customer who seemed quite unsatisfied, ChatGPT was my go-to tool for drafting responses.

It was surprisingly adept at suggesting responses that were empathetic, understanding, and solution-oriented. The outcome was amazing: the customer not only decided to stick with us but expanded their purchases and left a positive review. This experience demonstrated how AI can successfully assist in delicate situations, positively influencing real-life outcomes.",Daily,Tried it but don't use it,Tried it but don't use it,Daily,Tried it but don't use it,Never tried it,Never tried it,Never tried it,,Never tried it,,,Never tried it,,,,,Never tried it,,,,,

Something which is often neglected in businesses with all the dire consequences. Recent (mis)use of these tools caused data breaches in multiple corporations, like Samsung, where crucial trade secrets were leaked to these tools.
First, parent companies of these tools will store all content (prompts and responses) to improve its models. This means that all data fed to these tools will remain on their servers for forever. Which is something that you want to certainly avoid when working with sensitive data such as 
company secrets or personal information (storage limitation principle in the GDPR)
A second risk arises for non-US based companies since all content is processed and stored in the US. This is especially problematic when processing personal data in light of Schrems II. Where it was ruled that US Surveillance practices caused insufficient data protection of residents of the EU, thus making the transfer of personal data to the US 
unlawful.

For example, asking it to generate code using HTML, CSS, and JS to create a specific effect (like adding an animation to a background image) will sometimes produce code that attempts to achieve the desired result in more ways than one. In the animated background example, it actually gave me CSS and JS code that did the exact same thing, but it presented it as if both were needed. There are many other occasions where it does this to me -- creating redundant code in the same response to my prompt. I would like to see ChatGPT and other tools produce cleaner code, not just code that works. I'm not sure if it needs more ability to contextualize what is being asked or if it struggles when producing responses in multiple languages, but fixing that would be nice. ","I think it will certainly lessen the need for the same amount of developers needed to deliver results, but I don't see these tools completely replacing ALL software developers.

From the job description, I can ask chat to give me the most likely technical interview questions for a specific language or framework, have it provide me with detailed responses to each of those questions, and have it further include coding snippet examples that further reinforce my understanding of the topic. This was especially useful when reviewing the pillars of OOP and the SOLID principles with examples using Typescript. And if something was still not clicking for me, I could further prompt chat for more realistic/practical examples, have it provide me with analogies to better grasp a top-level understanding of the concept, and even present me with numerous resources for further in-depth study.",Weekly,Daily,Monthly,Weekly,Weekly,Tried it but don't use it,Never tried it,Never tried it,,Never tried it,,,Never tried it,,,,,Tried it but don't use it,,,,,

Most are shy/afraid to or don't know how they can ask what they need. So, for sure we need more prompt engineering, but also something like initial suggestions based on the role, age and purpose of the user, for example, kids usually want hep with math problems or cheat in write a paper, or analyzing a text for specific info. Someone that works at a desk job might need a template for a type of letter... sure theses are prompts, but present them as suggestions initially to make things easier, Bard somewhat does this, and so does the New Bing, but make it more relatable to the user. ",No,No,"I've had conversations to test the scope of the AI intelligence. I've used it to write letters, to analyze papers or articles.

For text writing, this results in bland, boring texts that are easily detected for plagiarism, and in coding, it means that when the standard code chosen by the AI will be unoptimized/subpar, it will have difficulty moving past the more bland and unoptimized code towards producing something more optimized for the programming task.

As for ways to improve on this, I believe that we would require smaller more curated and niche specific AI models. Models that have a greater bias for great code, or models that draw information from only very specific high-quality sources. However, the issue of producing wrong facts still won't be solved by this, and is something that requires a different type of protocol, such as adding prompts that work similar to commands, for example, the idea of creating ""fact check"" prompts.",Yes,Yes,"I use it all the time, from helping me with writing texts, to brainstorming new ideas, and even to understand certain concepts, such as equations or programming commands.","3D model generation is super cool!

It has been a valuable tool for generating code snippets, providing suggestions, and helping me identify and correct mistakes in my code.

Whenever I encounter a coding challenge or need assistance with a particular programming language, I can rely on ChatGPT to provide me with relevant code examples and explanations. It helps me save time by generating boilerplate code or offering alternative approaches to solve a problem.

Furthermore, ChatGPT's ability to understand programming concepts and syntax allows me to ask specific questions about my code and receive helpful feedback. It's like having a coding companion available anytime to bounce ideas off of and get guidance on best practices.

Using ChatGPT for code-related tasks has not only improved my coding efficiency but also enhanced my learning experience. It exposes me to different coding styles, techniques, and solutions that I might not have considered before.

Overall, ChatGPT has been a valuable resource in my programming journey, assisting me in generating code snippets, correcting mistakes, and expanding my coding knowledge.","Code Generation and Assistance.

I also asked it to provide strong arguments against fur industry. Its arguments were more less right but nothing original. I also asked it to write some code for me, for example to write a snake game in JavaScript and then to rewrite it in C with GDI. JavaScript version worked fine but C version crashed on startup, however, I guess it was a small mistake because code makes sense. I was very impressed. I also asked it to write Multi-Document Interface for a personal project in React and then to rewrite in pure JavaScript. I was impressed with the results. There was a small bug and I fixed it. However, I ended-up not using that code because I decided to write a native desktop application instead and desktop toolkits have MDI already implemented. I will definitely find a use of ChatGPT for programming projects but in quite rare cases. It is already maybe more than 6 months when I am aware about what ChatGPT can do and I still never find it useful for my day-to-day tasks. Moreover, I prefer code from stackoverflow which is already reviewed by people.

Having in mind all the architecture, the tradeoff of a solution based on a specific context, the business requirements etc. is not something an AI can easily do (in the short run, at least). My only concern is for junior developer, for two main reasons : the first is that they can rely too often on AI and accept generated code as is, without questioning it and understanding the reasoning behind it. It would thus hinder their progress and reduce their curiosity and creativity. The second one is that I fear that employers that don't really understand coding will think they will be able to cut many junior or internships developer jobs thanks to AI, instead of seeing it as something that empowers coders (instead of replacing it).
